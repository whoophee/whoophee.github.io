### 0. For the uninitiated.
Seeing as I'll be using several jargons in this post, visit the [Dota 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dota_2#Gameplay) Wikipedia page that perfectly covers the basics of the game.

### 1. Genesis
#### -apneng
As the title suggests, DotA Allstars [6.73](https://liquipedia.net/dota2/Version_6.73) was the first map I played. I had absolutely no clue about heroes or any idea on how to improve. It was a simpler time.

Getting pummelled game after game by AI opponents led me to believe that some heroes were better than the rest (a stupid idea at that) and I started learning one of these heroes in an attempt to beat the learning curve.

#### Invoker = Ego trip
*"Accomplish the hardest task to satisfy your ego" - No one ever*

In a game dominated by heroes with four spells, [Invoker](https://liquipedia.net/dota2/Invoker) had ten. Expectedly, the minimum skill required to play the hero was above average. With that in mind, I set out to play Invoker and even managed to get a decent grip on the workings of the hero. I conveniently assumed that once I was better at a difficult hero, I could play the easier ones effortlessly.

#### The chess analogy no one asked for.
With enough experience, chess becomes a game of intuition. Players are familiar with most of the board states over the first 3-5 moves. This familiarity is a result of sufficient study and practice of certain opening sequences. However, repeated use of a complex sequence makes the player none the wiser to board states that are consequences of simpler openings. Even though the bigger picture remains the same, the ease with which the players execute the variations would differ greatly.

Similarly in Dota, the unfamiliarity with the strengths and limitations of a hero creates a huge difference in the finesse with which they're played.

### 2. Ramshackle team
There were several others who were equally oblivious to the game, which resulted in a few makeshift teams.
With a few weeks of [playdota](https://playdota.com/) guided games, I went from knowing to play a single hero to having small hero puddle. We started defeating AI controlled teams with ease, and playing other teams seemed like the obvious next step.

We participated in a tournament, picked Viper, Slardar, Huskar, Lich and Spirit Breaker, and quite unsurprisingly got decimated. I was disappointed, not in that we lost but in that we had absolutely no clue on how we lost. The other captain suggested that we watch/study professional games and learn from them.

### 3. Dota 2
All this while, we'd been playing DotA Allstars, a Warcraft 3 mod. Despite being at its infancy, Dota 2 had vastly better graphics owing to [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_(game_engine)) (game engine).

I spent time learning Dota 2 and berating it all the whilst. Certain nuances such as using several smaller shops to purchase a single compound item no longer existed in Dota 2. As a player who spent time getting used to these nuances, this QoL improvement seemed like a betrayal, in that newer players wouldn't have to gruel quite as much. However, after watching professional games I quickly came to realize that these minor skill based relaxations had little to no impact on the bigger picture. The learning curve of the game was massive and multidimensional, and this was but a blip on that curve.

### 4. Hooked
There exists a world of difference between "playing to win" and "playing to not lose".

It is not sufficient that I play chess as a game of protecting my pieces and threatening theirs. The game must revolve around a veritable strategy that somehow leads to an end game. It requires the players to actively push forward to their win condition.

I was playing Dota 2 to have fun and was content with my footing in the game; i.e. I had no motivation to get better at the game. At the point, I had watched several professional games, but this single match went on to change my entire perspective of the game.
#### The other side.

Players expect certain moves and are usually well prepared to counter them. Although this mechanic was known to exist in the game, teams seldom took the risk of executing such an uncertain combination and understandably, had little to no experience playing against them. In the video, Tongfu's unpreparedness against this line of play crippled them, eventually losing them the game.

I had a few takeaways from this match.
* In a game of equal skill, mental fortitude is everything.
* The possibilities for creativity and outplays is endless.
* This is a game of sheer practice and grit.

The idea of outplaying opponents was a facet of the game that I was instantly drawn to. I also realized that I wouldn't improve overnight and that my getting better at the game was only a matter of time.

I have gone on to love and enjoy the game ever since.
